## Portfolio Topic  
This portfolio outlines a student registration portal for a fictional college called Loney University.  The portal contains the critical elements to register for a class, including a database consisting of the registered students and the available courses for registration.  Functionality has been built, using mySQL and PHP, to register for classes and view registrations once they have been made.  There have also been admin pages added to perform general CRUD operations on the student and class tables via an html interface.

### Phase 1

For the first phase of this project, I had developed and planned the setup.  The setup was based on a design from a college course, where we had planned a student registration portal.  I decided to build that planned project from scratch for this portfolio.  The question was in how to approach it from a coding perspective.  In the end, I decided to code it in PHP with a mySQL database.  For the look and feel of the overall site, I decided to use jquery and bootstrap styling rules for the look of the buttons and the alerts in particular.  Below is a sample of some of that bootstrap code at work.

For an example of how the look came out, the site is fully published at http://ianmloney.com ans is fully functional.
