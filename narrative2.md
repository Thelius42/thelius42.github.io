## Narrative for Phase 2

This narrative was written at the time of the code development

This week, I built on the foundation of a home page and create functionality of the website to include the other core CRUD functions.  This includes pages that allow you to view the current contents of each table and links that allow you to modify and delete existing entries.  As shown here, the modify page takes you to yet another page with a form that allows you to edit that specific entry based on its primary key.  The delete gives a pop-up confirmation, and then proceeds with the deletion.  As this is a new project, this has all been written within the past week.
  
The core of my overall project is to create a registration portal, but as I have gone I have felt that it also needed the ability to make changes to the database of available classes and students.  This was part of the core functionality outlined in my original IT315 planned project, so it seemed proper to include it here.  In my first milestone, I had a somewhat vague idea of what I wanted my second artifact to be.  As it turns out, developing the php interface for pulling the data has proven, I think, to be a more than adequate display of abilities involving data structures.  Especially when combined with the bootstrap output tables and buttons that have given the website the rather neat and easy to follow flow that it has at this point.  Attached is a screenshot of the update class records page as an example of how far things have come.  Every one of the buttons is fully functional and working as intended.
  
As this functionality was not initially part of my plan, I feel I have certainly met and even exceeded the ideas I hoped to cover in Module One.  Adding the full CRUD functionality gives the website a level of usability that was simply not there.  One thing I had been hoping to include and that I just donâ€™t think I will have time to figure out, however, is an authentication page for the system.  The database config page simply has the database user in plain text, and in the real world that level of security would not be acceptable.  That may be an enhancement that will have to wait until I potentially present this to a real employer, however. 
  
To call this project an artifact is not doing it justice.  This is essentially an entire website.  The challenges have been quite numerous.  My original attempt had me writing the entire api myself from scratch for the database entries and retrievals.  That proved well beyond my skills and ultimately unnecessary though.  PHP was a scripting language I had never worked with before but it has turned out to be an extraordinarily powerful tool.  The syntax is somewhat arcane though, so Google has definitely been my best friend through all of this development.  W3 schools and codeofaninja.com have been particularly useful and will definitely be cited in my final portfolio.  I am excited to see how the end project comes out.
